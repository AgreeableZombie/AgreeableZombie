### Installing Dependencies

From the root directory run:
```
npm install

npm install -g nodemon webpack

npm install mongoose
```

```
webpack --watch
node server.js
Visit `localhost:8000` in the browser.
mongo


**The server file is in the root directory for easy access, but there is a server 
folder where all logic will be stored.
